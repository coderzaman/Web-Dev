    <h1>Multimedia Formats</h1>
    <p>
        Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.
        The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension. Multimedia files have
        formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.
    </p>

    <h4>Common Video Formats</h4>
    <p>
        There are many video formats out there. The <b>MP4, WebM, and Ogg</b> formats are supported by HTML. The
        <b>MP4</b> format is recommended by YouTube.
    </p>

    <h4>Common Audio Formats</h4>
    <p>MP3 is the best format for compressed recorded music. The term MP3 has become synonymous with digital music. Only
        <b>MP3, WAV, and Ogg</b> audio are supported by the HTML standard.</p>

    <h4>The HTML video Element</h4>
    <p>The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
        It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might
        flicker while the video loads.
        The source element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser
        will use the first recognized format.
    </p>

    <video src="media/movie.mp4" controls width="400" height="250"></video>

    <p>To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute:</p>
    <video src="media/movie.mp4" autoplay controls width="400" height="250"></video>

    <p>Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted):</p>
    <video src="media/movie.mp4" autoplay muted controls width="400" height="250"></video>

    <h4>The HTML <audio> Element</h4>
    <p>The HTML "<"audio">" element is used to play an audio file on a web page.</p>
    <p>The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
    The source element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.</p>

    <audio controls src="media/cat-meow.mp3"></audio>
    <p>To start an audio file automatically, use the autoplay attribute:</p>
    <audio controls autoplay src="media/cat-meow.mp3"></audio>
    <p>Add muted after autoplay to let your audio file start playing automatically (but muted):</p>
    <audio src="media/cat-meow.mp3" autoplay controls muted></audio>
